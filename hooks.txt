The component goes through 3 phases during its lifecycle..
1- Mount - When an instance of a component is created and inserted into a dom.. 
There are a few special methods that we can add to our components.. These are called lifecycle hooks.. React will automatically call these methods..
These methods allow us to hook into certain moments during the lifecycle of a component and do something

-> constructor
-> render
-> componentDidMount

2- UPDATE

-> render
-> componentDidUpdate

3- UNMOUNT

-> componentDidUnmount
